## Description 
A simple coding quiz for your pleasure.

## How to use:
Start the quiz by clicking the "start quiz" button on the first screen. The timer will start and you have 60 seconds to complete the quiz. For each question, click the answer you deem most appropriate. If correct or incorrect, an explanation and a "next" button will appear under the answer options. Each time you get a question wrong 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer, so be careful! Once you have answered all the questions you can enter your initials to save your highscore, and get it displayed on the next page. Once you are on the last page, you can click "go back" to go to the beginning of the quiz, or click clear highscore to clear your highscore. At any time you can click "view highscore" in the top left to view your current highscore. If you run out of time you will lose and have to click the "go back" button to restart the quiz. Enjoy!
